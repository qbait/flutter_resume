# flutter_resume

The app consists in my own CV.

The app is simple, but is ready to scale. It shows a modern approach to developing a mobile app using Flutter and MobX architecture. 

To see how I approached the same problem with Native Android Development, you can take a look at my project [Resume](https://github.com/qbait/Resume)

## Libraries Used

- [MobX](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx) 
- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
- [Json Serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable)
- [Chopper](https://pub.dev/packages/chopper)
